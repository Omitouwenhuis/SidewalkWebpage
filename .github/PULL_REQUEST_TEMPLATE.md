##### Things to check before submitting the PR <!-- if something doesn't apply, just check the box or remove the line -->
- [ ] If there is a visual design component, I've posted before/after screenshots on the relevant issue thread and have been given a thumbs up on my design.
- [ ] I've asked for and added translations for any user facing text that was added or modified.
- [ ] I've updated logging if applicable. Clicks, keyboard presses, and other interactions should be logged in the `audit_task_interaction` or `validation_task_interaction` tables. If you added/modified an element that users can interact with, you may need to add/change the logging. Links between pages should be logged in the `webpage_activity` table. If you're not sure if you need to update the logging, ask Mikey.
- [ ] I've added/modified comments for large or confusing blocks of code.
- [ ] I've made sure my code and comments follow the [style guide](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/SidewalkWebpage/wiki/Style-Guide).
- [ ] I've tested on multiple browsers.
- [ ] I've tested as an Anonymous user, Registered user, and as a Turker.
- [ ] I've tested in both English and Spanish.
- [ ] I've tested on both desktop and mobile (as of Aug 2020, only need to test mobile for validation sign in page changes).
- [ ] I've verified that this PR is set to merge into the develop branch.
- [ ] I've written a descriptive PR title.
